## ‚öôÔ∏è Game Mechanics

- **Gravity and Bounce**: The ball's movement is influenced by gravity, and it bounces when it hits platforms.
- **Platform Generation**: New platforms are generated dynamically as the game progresses.
- **Difficulty Increase**: The game's difficulty increases by speeding up the platforms and making the ball move faster as the score increases.

## üé® Customization

You can easily customize the game by modifying the code:

- **Change Platform Colors**: Adjust the `ctx.fillStyle` in the `drawPlatforms` function.
- **Modify Ball Speed**: Change the `ballMoveSpeed` variable to adjust the ball‚Äôs speed.
